serve_paths:
  # This section allows for specific mounts to be used for different paths.
  # _ is used for the root mount. This will be `/`. If you used "public", your path would be `/public`. This works with the file_server.base_path variable.
  # You cannot nest or use multiple directories in each mount.
  "_":
    path: "/srv/http"
    type: "static"
  "public":
    path: "/mnt/files/opendir"
